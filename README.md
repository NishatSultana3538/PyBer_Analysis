# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the PyBer analysis: 
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.


## Results: 
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type


Here in PyBer analysis project I create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The code  [PyBer_Challenge](https://github.com/NishatSultana3538/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer_Challenge.ipynb)
The line graph I got is as below

* How is the school summary affected? After caculation the new school summary math , reading score and math, reading and overall percentage changes slightly.

* How does replacing the ninth graders math and reading scores affect Thomas High Schools performance relative to the other schools?
Replacing ninth graders data slightly changes math and reading scores for Thomas High Schools performance relative to the other schools. 
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

## Summary: 

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
Changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs are as follows:

1. Scores by school size was slightly changes in medium size(1000-2000) school data. 
2. Scores by school spending was slightly changes in $630-644 range data. 
3. Scores by school type was slightly changes in charter type school data.
4. School Summary data and District Summary data was changed slightly for the math & reading score and percentages.

### Conclusion

The School_District_Analysis data after replacing reading and math scores changes only slightly in the district data and school summary data as the number of student in 9th grade in Thomas High School (461) is few compared to total student (39170).
